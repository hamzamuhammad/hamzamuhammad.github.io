What did you do this past week?

- Submitted my first round of assignments. I also took a bunch of OOP quizzes as well, and started to get into the thick of things. Unfortunately, even more assignments were assigned!

What's in your way?

- I screwed up my OOP project #1 submission by forgetting to include a .gitignore file. This cost me 20% of the project grade! I felt extremely bad for making such a stupid mistake, but it taught me an important lesson: be more vigilant and take things seriously. After all, things aren't supposed to be easy; otherwise, what's the point?

What will you do next week?

- Finish the assignments due for the next week, and try to find a partner for OOP. In addition, I may pull a few all nighters in order to fully catch up with stuff and get my routine back in shape. I did this for 439, and it worked out well.


Possibly the most important stuff that was taught to us was the concept of references, pointers, and local variables. The difference is slight but important in order to become a more versatile programmer. For example, using an & allows one to assign a different name to a variable. You can combine this with pointers, addresses, etc. and it can make code easier to read and understand.

However, this is hard to fully grasp. Thats why I plan on going over this and possibly doing some examples as to how pointers/references exactly work in C++. It's important to not get this confused with concepts from other languages, such as C or Java, since certain aspects mean different things. For example, in Java there is no way to get the address by using & of a variable or pointer. Instead, all objects are essentially 'protected' and is only useful at a rudimentary level.

This methodology has some advantages, however. Easier pointer and memory management equals faster development at the expense of less efficient and lean code. OOP spends a fair amount on the differences between Java and C++ as a way of teaching us how to analyze the differences between languages. I believe that Programming Languages, another CS upper division elective, may go more in depth into this topic.

All in all, OOP is starting to catch steam and I'm excited for what's next :)
