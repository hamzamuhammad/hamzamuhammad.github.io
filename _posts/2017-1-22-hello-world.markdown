What did you do this past week?

- Enjoyed the laxness of syllabus week, and started to plan out how I plan on spending my semester. I have to start applying for full-time jobs, so I made an effort to start doing that! I also purchased textbooks for my other 2 non-CS classes, and pretty much got into the groove of my schedule as well as dropping classes I didn't feel like I'd want to take. 

What's in your way?

- Have to make sure I don't miss on my various appointments setup regarding various things, as well as maintaining my healthy eating routine. I also have to begin interview prep (at some point) and really get my stuff together.

What will you do next week?

- Continue applying to jobs, as well as start interview prep. Focus on doing well in my classes and generally have fun!

Tip of the week

- Remember to stay hydrated! You should be drinking roughly 2L of water a day!

I already took OOP with Downing last semester, and I really enjoyed the class. I chose to take the "web" equivalent of Software Engineering simply because I've heard it's a super practical and interesting class. I also want to get a solid grasp of Python, since it's a popular language at the core of many modern technologies. 

What's interesting is that Python has a different way of executing code, with the introduction of the interpreter as a tool. C++ was more "run it and see" which will make debugging and consequently development possibly easier. However, the idea of unit testing is common to both classes. 

I anticipate that the class will become vastly different after a few weeks, since the introductory material is giving me flashbacks to last semester! I am also super hyped to get the Writing Flag from this class. The only concern I have are the daily quizzes, which absolutely wrecked me last semester. Oh well! At least I'm not taking Algo as well.
