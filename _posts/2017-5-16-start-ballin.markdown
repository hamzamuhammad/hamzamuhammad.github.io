**What did you do this past week?**

- Finished the SWE and security final, turned in some final assignments, and pretty much finished everything EXCEPT for a final project in a class that's due in a few days.

**What's in your way?**

- Learn how to cook some decent food, start eating healthy, and start a new workout that'll lean more to conditioning and endurance. Also, I have to shop around for a car (to commute with) and figure out the final project due in a few days.

**What will you do next week?**

- Relax for a bit, get a gym membership, grocery shop for yummy food, order an SSD, catch up on new movies that I missed.

**Tip of the week**

- Take Object-Oriented Programming with Downing next semester!

**Experience of the class**

To whoever is reading this and contemplating taking SWE, I'll break down the pros and cons of the class and whether it's a good fit for you.

The pros far outweigh the cons - SWE forces you to learn a lot of new technologies and essentially use all of your CS skills to accomplish an objective. You will gain possibly the best project-based experience of any CS elective by taking this class. It will also probably be the most practical knowledge compared to other classes. It's good to have a bunch of solid technologies to put on your resume, and SWE does a good job regarding that. 

There is also a ton of real-life software engineering advice - especially towards the last part of class with regards to design patterns. Many different languages are covered, from introducing Python to certain aspects of SQL.

However, the downside of SWE is the lack of "course material" in the sense of a traditional class. For example, in Algo you had a textbook and a pretty clear structure (concept covered in textbook or class, then various practice problems). There is not that much reinforcement of the skills taught in SWE to the extent that you'd expect, and that's just the design of the class. Whichever endeavor you choose to pursue may use certain skills, and you'll have to learn on the go. So if you're looking for a "I'll fully learn XYZ" then SWE may not be the class for it. I'd recommend something like OOP or iOS for greater depth and focus on a topic.

All in all, I'd recommend taking SWE as it's a must-take class for any aspiring software engineer.
