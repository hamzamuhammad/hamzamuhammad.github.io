**What did you do this past week?**

- First week back from spring break, so we had to grind out the first phase of the project (IDB1) which proved fairly challenging since we were on a short schedule. 

**What's in your way?**

- Security project due this week as well as some other miscellaneous items. I don't expect to have way too much work, so I'll take it easy.

**What will you do next week?**

- Part 2 of the project will be due, so we will probably have to clutch that as well and spend a bit more time on that compared to part 1 (due to the dynamic nature of the data as well as creation of a database).

**Tip of the week**

- Have faith.

**Experience of the class**

Actually building and hosting a web app turned out to be fairly difficult in terms of setting up the entire stack. GCP was the first hurdle, and since the documentation is fairly comprehensive for sample apps, there was little trouble getting it setup. However, there was an issue with regards to getting certain libraries to play nice (we ended up installing a bunch of helper packages on macOS) and after that it was smooth sailing.

We started on the frontend by using some common bootstrap templates and consequently tweaked the pages until we were satisfied with the design. The carousel took a bit of work, since the website needs to work on mobile, so a certain template was needed. Likewise, we had to work on the actual pages for the tables/grids and consequently we redesigned certain aspects when information became available on Piazza.

The teamwork was great, save for some issues with pushing/merging branches and submitting code that was fully functional. These are minor issues, since fixing broken code and integrating it into our system was better than completing the function AND fixing the code as well. We also ran into issues with the browser and refreshing the web page (running it locally as well as the server).

All in all, it was a fun project and I look forward to the next phase. Hopefully it will go smoother than before since we already have the practice and base setup!
