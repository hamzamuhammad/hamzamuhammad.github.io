What did you do this past week?

- Submitted the allocator lab as well as other forms of work. I feel like the projects are progressively getting harder (which is a good thing). We are more than halfway done with the semester, so I am excited to see the end of the semester fly by :)

What's in your way?

- Have to start on Darwin as well as start preparing much in advance for the algo test next Wednesday. In addition, there is an algo homework due on Thursday and I have another essay due in my perspectives on deafness class. Also, I'm trying to avoid getting sick, since a cold seems to be going around my peers.

What will you do next week?

- Next week I will be doing algo homework as usual, and writing my essay for perspectives on deafness. I've got a strict lifting regiment to stick to, so as always you know I will be making those gains. Need to find a partner for Darwin soon so I can get started on that ASAP. I do not want to be stressing out about both the algo test and doing all of Darwin next week. 

Tip of the week

- Go to Chiptole and order a double side of chicken with guac. Gain City. Bet.

This week we discussed the default methods C++ provides classes with. As we've talked about before every class comes with a default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, and assignment operator. Taking a look at the code C++ provides for the default, we saw that much of it was unreasonable and inefficient. As a class we rewrote these methods to actually do the things we wanted them to do, and with more efficiency. 

Furthermore, the Darwin project introduces the concept of taking a model and implementing it using object-oriented design principles. Figuring out what data structures and algorithms to use in order to get the game up and running seems to be the biggest challenge so far. However, we have had experience with this sort of thing in the past in CS314 with GridWorld.

I look forward to having full creative control on a project so I can learn what principles work and fail with regarding to designing a project. Having more flexibility allows us to use more creative solutions (but we of course have certain restrictions such as not using any heap memory whatsoever). Hopefully Darwin is not as difficult as everybody else said it was!
