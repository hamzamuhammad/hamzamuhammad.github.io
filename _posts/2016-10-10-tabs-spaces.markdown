What did you do this past week?

- I really had to crack down and study alot for the OOP test this past week. Between working out and studying I barely had time to do anything else. I studied with a bunch of other people also in OOP so I felt pretty prepared going into the exam. The exam started late which was a little annoying because I made plans to chill with friends and find dank memes afterwards. Downing told us to get to the exam early so that everyone could get checked in and even though everyone was there early, they didn't start checking in students until the exam was already supposed to start. 

What's in your way?

-  The sheer amount of various tasks I need to get done will be the challenge this week. Not only do I have a bunch of school work to do: an essay, algo homework, starting the OOP project, and taking notes in my classes, I also have alot of "real life" errands to complete. Doctor's appointment, flu shot to get, and a dentist's appointment. Gotta keep these horn's healthy ;)

What will you do next week?

- Next week I will be running around getting all those various items done. I hope I will have time to work out but the chances of that are looking pretty slim. I need to find a partner for the next OOP project, because those extra credit 5 points will come in clutch.

Tip of the week

- Keep yourself healthy! It's an annoying bit of work to do, but going to the doctor and dentist is essential to do. As they always say: a pair of healthy horns is a pair of happy horns!

A lot of talk about iterators this past week in class. Range iterators, digit iterators, and all other types of iterators. We worked on creating our own iterators, implementing them, and creating containers to use iterators. Good thing I paid attention because much of what we discussed in class showed up on the test. We only had 2 days of class this week in OOP, since Friday class was cancelled due to the test. Gave me plenty of time to improve my Smash game and beat the other plebs who think they can compare to my skills.

Taking the test through Canvas was pretty annoying. I would much rather type code in a C++ IDE, then port it over to the canvas text editor, rather than having to press space like 4 billion times to equal one tab. As Richard from Silicon Valley said, spaces instead of tabs are super scrub tier. It also is less efficient, believe it or not!

I am excited to start on the next chapter of my OOP journey with regards to memory management. This is probably the biggest plus to using C++ instead of a language like Java, since managing your own memory allows for much more efficient code. Faster code also means that you can implement "slower" algorithms yet have the code run reasonably fast (like doing collatz in C++ vs Java).

I am very much looking forward to the next third of the semester!
