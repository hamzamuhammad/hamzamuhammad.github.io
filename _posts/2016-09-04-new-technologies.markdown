What did you do this past week?

- I started to get into the groove of my classes, especially the quizzes and reading about the assignments. I made sure to start early, and compile a list of questions if I had any.

What's in your way?

- I sort of neglected the readings in order to work more on the projects, and so I have to catch up on that stuff during Monday. I also have to go to TA hours and make sure my project 1 is ready for submission.

What will you do next week?

- I will probably have some more work in classes besides OOP, so I will focus my efforts on that. However, I will still keep up to date on the readings and anticipate my next project.


In one lecture, we were taught the different between pre and post-increment operators and the consequence of using them to assign values to variables. This was very interesting, since I haven't had a really strong grasp of what this exactly meant. Now, whenever I'm writing code, I can fully use this feature of the language that most people don't know much about.

Also, we were taught more information regarding exception handling and how throwing exceptions really works. An interesting thing is that you can throw an exception at the lowest level of the code infrastructure, and choose to catch it at the highest level simply by letting it recursively bounce back up.

Lastly, I really appreciated the outline that was given in class regarding how to go about the project. It made the entire process extremely clear and helped me in setting up the project. However, there was still a lot of 'extra' learning that I had to do, such as learning the new technologies and debugging various tools that I had no experience with.

All in all, I feel like I am learning a great deal about real software development especially with the various tools that are used to ensure rigorously tested code.
