**What did you do this past week?**

- Pretty much nothing. Started on interview prep, spammed internship applications, and enjoyed the pleasures of having not way too many demanding classes! I do not encourage students to take 'blow off' classes, but then again you have to prioritize what you want to spend time on!

**What's in your way?**

- Keep up with interview prep, start interviewing with companies/finishing coding challenges, and make a great impact when I'm at the FoCS event or the career fair. I wrote an iPhone app over winter break, so lets see how impressed employers will get looking at some cool thing on a phone. 

**What will you do next week?**

- Pretty much repeat what I've been doing until I get an internship, then I will promptly start slacking off and spend my days watching Comedy Central and binge eating gummy worms. I may be either overstating or understating the difficulty of getting an internship, so I always go with the former and try my hardest.

**Tip of the week**

- A cool album cover usually means dope music.

**Experience of the class**

The real stuff is about to happen with the netflix project. We did the same thing last year, but of course C++ is blindingly fast. There was an external boost library people used to speed up the entire process (which me and my partner did not bother to use) but it seems that we have to do a lot of fancy stuff with the Python version.

As for the specifics with regards to what we're learning in class, Python seems to have a bunch of arbitrary rules. This seems odd (probably because I was initially taught Java first), but it looks random compared to C++ or Java. 

This highlights a problem I tend to see time and time again, and a popular phrase captures this idea perfectly - "when you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail". Only learning one language can handicap someone's thought process with regards to efficient problem solving. For example, only using C for ALL tasks can provide great performance benefits at the cost of development speed. Where should one draw the line and strike a balance for the current day and age?

I made it a priority to learn as many different languages and technologies I can, so I can accurately discern the pros/cons of certain approaches/tools as well as get better at learning new material. This is sort of why getting a certification in certain disciplines is frowned upon in the tech world (with regards to certain positions, that is).

Learning how to learn is a crucial aspect of life in general, and I believe taking SWE is a great way to expose oneself to new stuff.
