What did you do this past week?

- Took the OOP final and turned in some of the final assignments for my classes. I had to take the alternate final because of a conflicting class (iOS). My iOS presentation went pretty decently, but we still have a lot of functionality and bugs to implement before we turn in the final version of our app!

What's in your way?

- I have an algo test on Monday, iOS due on Thursday, and some other minor stuff the week after that. My main concern is algo, so the second after that test, I cannot wait for what emotions I will be feeling. Putting a semester of college behind you is a pretty good feeling tbqhwyf (to be quite honest with you fam).

What will you do next week?

- Take the last of my tests, then structure my winter break to be productive. Turns out that I may have to start applying for full-time positions next semester (ya boi is trying to graduate fall 2017!). I definitely have to crack open Cracking the Coding Interview and start grinding harder than a grindstone on interview prep. In addition, I need to start work on an iOS app as a side project. I'll put it on the app store, so watch out for the hottest thing since Bonzi Buddy to drop!!!

Tip of the week

- You're the product of millenia of successful evolution. Act like it.

OOP has been an interesting adventure. There was a lot of hype regarding Professor Downing, and after a semester it's safe to say the hype was legit. It was a fun class that reminded me of CS314 with Scott, especially with the coding tests and various questions about understanding code.

As for the bread and butter of the class, it was sort of like that one fairy tale with the bears eating oatmeal or something. Just right! The projects were fun (although we didn't really get object-oriented until project 3), tests were great, but the quizzes were savage. I've been having daily quizzes in OOP and algo, and although I didn't bother studying for them (I probably should have, but money ain't nothing but a thang) I did pretty decent. Don't get me wrong, daily quizzes is a good idea to force you to pay attention and shock you into doing super well on the other stuff. HOWEVER, I would much rather have substituted like 2 additional projects instead of quiz grades, simply because I prefer heavy programming over multiple-choice questions. 

Now, coming out of OOP, I feel like I have an intermediate grasp of C++. There are still some things I may have to Google before they get ingrained in my brain like it is with Java, but the major hurdle of debugging C++ code and handling the 'ugly' stuff (pointers, memory allocation, constructors, etc.) OOP covered really well. 

This should honestly be a required class, simply because learning another language like C++ increases your skill as a programmer greatly. You learn the design of a language and its pros and cons. Furthermore, Downing makes sure to hammer home how important proper software engineering should be (using Github and TravisCI) and correctly introduces development in a new language. 

If you want a crash-course in C++, this is the class to take. 

Professor Downing, thank you for the awesome experience. Keep rocking that Polo.
