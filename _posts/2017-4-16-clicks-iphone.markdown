**What did you do this past week?**

- Relaxed for the week, but we had a security project that was fairly straightforward for us. I also got back into my lifting routine and had to unwind after the grind session of last week's. 

**What's in your way?**

- The final phase of IDB is due, which is not too much compared to the prior phase. We just have to implement a search button (which will use some JavaScript magic!) and other miscellaneous tasks. It's going to be fairly chill as well.

**What will you do next week?**

- Finish the SWE project, and we have registration! I'm very confused as to what to take, given my pretty good registration time. I want to have as much time off as possible, because I may plan on working part-time at a tech company in Austin.

**Tip of the week**

- Make sure to claim all of your AP credit to boost your degree completion (and consequently your registration time!) 

**Experience of the class**

We've moved back to Java, one of the first programming languages I learned. After coding in Python for a fair amount of time, I've come to appreciate the flexibility that Python provides when compared to Java. However, I've realized that having a tighter control on the language and things in general allows for very clear interpretation of other people's code. There have been times when I wrote Python code and looking back at it, I forgot what the code does! This is a by product of having a weakly typed system, e.g. am I looking at a dictionary or a list? You have to go back through the code and get the full picture. Java is different in the sense that it's clear what type an ArrayList or a Dictionary is. 

Going through the various refactoring patterns brought back some common tactics we've all used to fix code and make it more readable and maintainable. For example, moving logic to certain parts of the code helps to encapsulate object behavior. I faced this problem while designing my personal projects, especially when I had to write a lot of 'spaghetti code' to make certain things work. I then realized that I can avoid this huge hurdle by zooming out and designing the bigger components better.

I'm satisfied with the direction the class has taken, going from Python to mySQL to refactoring patterns. It's a holistic view of software engineering in general, and provides a ton of helpful tools and ideas going forward in any tech-oriented career. The only downside I see is that spending a few weeks on topics that have great complexity may leave students wanting for more, but I'm more than happy with a solid dosage or sample of a technology. If you need to master it or use some advanced features, then there are tons of resources online! After all, learning to learn is the point of college in my opinion.
