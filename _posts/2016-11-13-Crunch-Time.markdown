What did you do this past week?

- Relaxed super hardcore for most of the week. iOS was due, so I had to clutch super hard and finish the Beta for the project. It was very interesting to get stuff done in Swift when we've been writing in C++ all this time in OOP!

What's in your way?

- Finish the algo hmwk and the final OOP project, Life. I think I might tear up when I submit the JSON. I am surely going to miss all of the travis CI messages I get through email.

What will you do next week?

- Complete the final assignments, and hopefully get an idea of what to finish before the exam prep begins. I know that iOS is due after thanksgiving break, and I have some essays/web journals for my 4th class to finish as well.

Tip of the week

- Sweet potato fries suck.

Life was much easier in comparison to Darwin, surprisingly. I didn't expect to finish Life as soon as we did, simply because both projects had the concept of a 2d grid and creatures. However, Life was easier because of 2 important facts: 1, there was inheritance and 2 there was no movement for each cell. 

Inheritance made the code shorter but at the same time more difficult. For example, there was a lot of sketchy casting as well as making a wrapper class that handles all of the pointer business. However, with more complexity there comes shorter code and more flexible behavior. Once all of the components were set up, writing the actual business logic for the runner code was trivial.

A tricky situation we ran into was how to deal with memory management. Since we could use new to create and store objects on the heap, our allocation and deallocation had to make sense. Therefore, we needed to create custom destructors for certain classes so the entire object deallocates itself cleanly.

After all of these projects, I feel like I have a stronger grasp of C++ but at the same time there is so much that I still do not know. I believe that C++ is a great language to know, and further practice is very helpful in the professional field. Windows development heavily relies on C++, and a lot of performance software requires this as well.
