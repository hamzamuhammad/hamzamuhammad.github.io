**What did you do this past week?**

- Took the SWE test (got absolutely rekt on it), and did a couple of interviews as well. I expect to hear back from a couple of companies, and the sooner I can clutch an offer, the better (since I can relax and proceed to slack off even harder for the remainder of the semester).

**What's in your way?**

- Security test & project are due within a few days of each other, so I gotta get that done. After that, it's spring break, BUT the SWE project is due the week after spring break. This means that the group has to divvy up the work and work a lil bit over the break.

**What will you do next week?**

- Finish whatever SWE stuff we decide on, and relax for a bit. I may have some interviews set up, so take those and then no clue what to do afterwards. Maybe go to six flags? Play games? Who knows fam.

**Tip of the week**

- WORK HARD PLAY HARD

**Experience of the class**

Now we're getting into the big meaty project that is at the epicenter of SWE. I'm ready to handle the new technologies and new skills needed to develop a cool web app. However, a challenge that I'm seeing is how to properly manage a group and accomplish a project especially with many group members. It's easy when you're working with friends, but with new people it's a challenge trying to make it all work. My mindset is to make friends first, then teammates afterwards, so the 'work environment' is more casual and collaborative rather than too academic or stiff.

An interesting pattern that we've already seen when analyzing phase 1 of the project, is that you can easily split the workload into front and backend portions. This dichotomy rose after looking at what pieces of the project are so interdependent that splitting up the work would make the resulting synthesis harder than it needs to be. However, a problem with such an approach is that the backend layout would theoretically need be to be laid first before any frontend work can be done. This prevents multiple people working at the same time (there are dependencies).

A huge portion of the work is documentation, which provides a unique insight into how the project should be designed and laid out. If you try to write and describe your design (similar to explaining it to another person), you can see and spot problems that you would not normally have seen. Many times, I faced similar problems with various personal projects - after writing down what I am doing/want to do the layout and architecture is much clearer!

All in all, I look forward to the project and want to further enhance my skills when it comes to working with a team to accomplish a project.
