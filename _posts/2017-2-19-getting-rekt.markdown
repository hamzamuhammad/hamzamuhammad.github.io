**What did you do this past week?**

- Had my first slew of interviews, and spammed resumes at both FoCS and the career fair. I felt like things went fairly well, but now it's a waiting game to see which companies are interested in ya boi. 

**What's in your way?**

- Prepare as much as possible for interviews, take whatever interviews I get, and hopefully get a nice offer. Also, I have a bunch of other stuff (like projects and whatnot) that I must attend to otherwise I'm gonna be in trouble later on!

**What will you do next week?**

- Prepare for the SWE test, finish an essay due next Sunday, and deal with the stress of upcoming midterms. On top of that, keep interviewing with companies and see what's in store for me.

**Tip of the week**

- YouTube has a great music suggestion algorithm!

**Experience of the class**

Python is a peculiar language, especially with all of the new functions such as map and zip that condense a 7-8 line method into a single line. It's very concise and optimized, so producing code in Python seems to be extremely efficient. The only downside is that understanding dense Python is difficult for those unversed in the syntax, so there's a tradeoff in that sense. In addition, Python is notorious for being a slow language compared to others, so I can tell that certain tricks and functions are not worth the time trade-off.

I encountered the disadvantages of a language such as Java while doing interview prep. For example, oftentimes I had to iterate through a HashMap (a Dictionary in Python), and the way of doing it is either pretty obnoxious (calling .iterator() on the object) or too verbose (calling some obscure method on the object in the for-each loop). Meanwhile, in Python, it's a simple and intuitive way which is 'for key, value in d.items()'.

However, with that being said, I'm not comfortable enough with Python to use it as my main coding language. I've been using Java since wheelies were out of style, and so I use it as a main 'thinking' language as well. Although the algorithm is really what matters (in the sense of pseudocode and whatnot), the language particulars can impact the process as well. For example, the idea of a tuple in Python can allow for easier conceptual structuring especially when it comes to designing certain data structures.

Imagine having a list of x,y coordinates. In Python, it could just be a list of tuples. However, in Java, you would either have to make a custom class to represent a coordinate OR abstract the data away in an ArrayList (if you plan on having multiple dimensions). Iterating and navigating through the Java option seems pretty obnoxious, and it gets worse if you want to perform list operations such as reduction and applying functions to lists. 

All in all, each language has it's pros and cons, and only through programming often will one really understand what to use and when!
