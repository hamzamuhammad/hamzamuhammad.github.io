**What did you do this past week?**

- The final assignments of the semester, and generally wrapping classes up. I am fairly ready for my finals, and I do not expect that much of a challenge. That, or I do not really see the necessity of studying a lot because the impact on my GPA will be fairly minimal.

**What's in your way?**

- 2 finals and a final project in my Hip-Hop music class. I don't expect to have as much stress as compared to last semester (where I had Algo and OOP!). I'm glad to be somewhat relaxed.

**What will you do next week?**

- Study for my tests, get some paperwork completed, and enjoy myself while everybody is still at school (since people are interning in different places during the summer).

**Tip of the week**

- Just do it.

**Experience of the class**

As the class winds down, I look back at how much I learned and what lessons I took from this class. We chose to keep our website up, youtubesweg.me, although we are running out of funds at a steady rate. It's up for nostalgia mainly, but it's a good thing to show off to recruiters. 

When I first sat in the front row of the Cisco room, I wondered what sort of challenges this class would present me with. I knew that we would be making a website at some point, which didn't sound like that much a challenge, but as I quickly found out it was a big hurdle to pass. I gained a plethora of skills that I would never get from any other class; namely the variety of technologies used in making a modern web app from the ground up. I also gained valuable experience in dealing with working with a team, in terms of reconciling differences with regards to design methodologies and other aspects programmers take for granted.

I also really enjoyed getting exposure to Python, which is a great language for certain usages (I plan on using it more in the future). I only used Java, C++, and C in the past, so Python was very refreshing and reminded me of Swift with regards to how flexible and fast to write it is.

All in all, as I prepare to take the final, I'm glad I took the class and I'll have a better grasp on software engineering in general!
