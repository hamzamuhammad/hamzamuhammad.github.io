**What did you do this past week?**

- Took a few quizzes, finished some homework as well. So far the workload is not that much compared to last semester, but I am still busy with regards to other activities (such as interview prep and jiu-jitsu). 

**What's in your way?**

- Keep up with preparing for interviews, especially with the career fair coming up in a few weeks. If I can cram CTCI in a few weeks, then I have a much better chance at performing well during interviews. In addition, I have to catch up on reading as well as finish the first SWE lab! 

**What will you do next week?**

- Keep up the current routine I have and try to keep myself preoccupied with all of my hobbies/work. For most people, after the workload really starts to hit, sacrifices are made with regards to how to accomplish goals most efficiently. I may have to accept a lesser social life when things start to get going.

**Tip of the week**

- Your first impression of a person is usually correct. 

**Experience of the class**

I just started using Python last night to create a brute-force solution for collatz, and the language is quite different from traditional languages such as C++ or Java. For example, the biggest change is the idea of using tabs as a replacement for brackets. It's pretty unnerving, especially when you've been using brackets since the early days of CS312. 

Furthermore, the lack of a type next to a variable name is freeing yet uncanny. It can also cause confusion if you're not careful, as evident by the quiz given in class today! Python seems to be a powerful language, yet loosely defined compared to other languages. 

Lastly, with regards to collatz, Python is much slower when compared to C++. We did collatz in OOP as well, but a lazy cache was good enough for the time constraints. Python, on the other hand, needs more sophisticated forms of optimization. Learning how to make it faster seems to be the tradeoff associated with a faster development language. 

I am very much looking forward to the big group project, since SWE seems to use many technologies that are popular with modern systems. Having experience with this looks good on a resume as well as can prepare people for internships!
