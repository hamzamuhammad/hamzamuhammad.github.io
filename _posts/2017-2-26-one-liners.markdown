**What did you do this past week?**

- Kept interviewing, and learned how to talk to various interviewers. It was a tricky skill to learn, because I messed up one of my first phone screens by answering a loaded question improperly. I then asked my dad and other friends as to how one should answer such questions, and so far the advice has worked!

**What's in your way?**

- SWE test and security test are coming up in the next few weeks, and I have miscellaneous assignments from other classes as well. I have a few interviews to finish up, so after that it's just a waiting game.

**What will you do next week?**

- Turns out that security has a bunch of stuff due on the same day, so I have to get started on that early. Also, if I have any further interviews, I'll have to schedule that as well.

**Tip of the week**

- Go to a restaurant, ask for a water cup, and put soda in it anyways! (just kidding)

**Experience of the class**

After having started preparing for the exam, I finally understood the beauty with programming in Python. Difficult tasks, such as passing a variable number of arguments, was made ridiculously simple by various mechanics. The code is short, clean, and concise, albeit difficult to understand. However, the only issue may be understanding the behavior of certain aspects of Python without using an interpreter. Of course, it's always better to have a terminal in front of you and experiment with code, but certain behavior could be difficult to grasp.

An example is how one can pass in arguments with labels in varying capacities, and the specifics as to how this is done is very interesting. However, I question the practical applications of various design decisions in Python (and this would apply to any programming language as well). The true judge of the usability of such items is programming in the language and seeing what and where it can be used. Simply speculating isn't enough to form an opinion!

I am appreciating the neat tricks and common coding patterns using Python simply because of the speed of the implementation. If I were to try the same tactics in Java, I anticipate some obtuse spaghetti code. However, the methodology with regards to thinking in Java (pun intended) somewhat changes when Python is used more. Understanding how to Python comes with practice, and finding the fancy shortcuts is a matter of trial and error.
