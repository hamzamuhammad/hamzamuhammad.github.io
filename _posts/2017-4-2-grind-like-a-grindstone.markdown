**What did you do this past week?**

- Completed a security project as well as finished some other miscellaneous tasks. It was somewhat of a stress-free week, but since we have the project to do I am looking forward to getting that out of the way.

**What's in your way?**

- IDB phase 2 is due on Thursday. Now it's time for the actual work (implementing the backend, frontend and connecting those two components and actually making it all work without it crashing a million times).

**What will you do next week?**

- Turn in the project, then chill for a week (until the security project is due on the following week, which I've heard is more tricky than the prior ones).

**Tip of the week**

- Your first instinct is usually correct.

**Experience of the class**

Now that I'm doing more and more research into the project, I begin to see the larger architectural and structural challenges to designing a complex web app that has a large degree of connectivity. This makes me understand and relate more to the issues that companies such as Amazon and Facebook face with regards to such large volumes of data. Even with our group having difficulty with a fairly small subject of data items, we gleaned a great deal of information regarding actual development processes.

Possibly the most useful tool in any sort of software engineering is the art of pair programming. It's very interesting to see how such a dynamic works out, because every partner/member of the group has a unique role to fill. It does not necessarily mean whoever comes up with all the algorithmic techniques or the approaches is the most important; he has a large impact, sure, but he still needs his supporting players to help accomplish the larger task. Take a basketball team, for example: it's ridiculous to expect a star player to score 60-70 points a game and carry the team to victory because the best teams have excellent teamwork and trust well integrated within them.

I personally am curious to work in the real world and see how the dynamic of group projects change especially when you cannot partner up with friends or people you're comfortable with. Communicating various ideas and reasonings is a tricky discipline to master especially in a new environment. People assume that all engineers speak the same 'language', but where one person decides to choose a short-term fix to get a product delivered on time versus someone who wants long-term guarantees at the risk of timing issues the dichotomy is interesting to say the least.

I look forward to working with my group and getting this project done, which will be one of the first large-scale things I'll embark on since the good ol' days of OS. I spent many nights in the GDC from sun up to sun up propelled by Wendy's and stress and I'm curious as to how my OS experience will affect this new project!
