**What did you do this past week?**

- I finished the last part of the SWE project and also finished some other miscellaneous items. I also got more information from my recruiter at Visa as to the coming steps with regards to my internship. I am excited yet nervous to begin; I'm eager to begin cashing out!

**What's in your way?**

- I only have 2 tests (as far as I know) and some final projects in my other non-CS classes. I expect a rough week ahead of me, so I'm relaxing as much as possible and enjoying the last few weeks of seeing certain friends!

**What will you do next week?**

- Start preparing for my SWE and security exam (both of which are on the same day!) and get ready to wind down for the remainder of the semester. I have a few more things not related to school (just some paperwork and navigating the government/school bureaucracy) that I'll finish along the way.

**Tip of the week**

- Whenever you have to do something, mask off.

**Experience of the class**

We faced a problem that highlighted the consequences of programming in Java for certain tasks. For example, we had to go through a bunch of functions in Java; there are various ways of solving this, but the clean and precise way of doing it is to put all the methods into a data structure (such as an array). Unfortunately, you cannot do this in Java unless you make each 'method' into an object that can be stored in a data structure such as an ArrayList. 

The disadvantage of this approach is that you must wrap each method (that would be in the main class) in it's own class. This approach is more convoluted, but is an easier way of handling calling N methods in, say, a for loop. In Python, you can simply append a function to a list and loop through the list and call that function.

However, it was a relief going back Java for a while due to how strongly typed it is. The debugging was easier, and structuring out the code was simpler with regards to classes and methods. Python seems very script-like and "design as you code" compared to Java. Maybe it's how I was trained in coding, but I always feel more comfortable with certain languages.

All in all, the more knowledge and more ways you can do something the better it is. In fact, knowing how it's done in Python helped us derive a similar solution in Java. It all builds on itself!
