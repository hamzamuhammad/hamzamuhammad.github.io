What did you do this past week?

- Finished up the final OOP project, and submitted the JSON for the last time. I think I may have teared up a bit!

What's in your way?

- I have an iOS project due right afte thankgiving break, along with starting the prep for the OOP final which will be on Thursday. I am pretty terrified because I've heard that this test is extremely hard.

What will you do next week?

- Finish the final algo hmwk, and overall just start relaxing for a few days before I really have to start working nonstop. I am going to fully enjoy the 2 or 3 days I get to do whatever I feel like.

Tip of the week

- Fried eggs are best eggs.

The extra credit on Kattis was interesting compared to UVa. It has a much cleaner layout and reminded me more of these convential sites like Hackerrank or Leetcode. However, the problem that we had to do for extra credit was very similar to the original Collatz problem, but with a slight twist.

Writing a problem solution in C++ sort of woke me up for a bit. It's much different than Java, simply because the syntax and language is stricter and tighter. I actually rewrote a Java solution in C++ so I could iron out the algorithm before dealing with various C++ issues. After I fixed the C++ solution, I kept getting a time limit exceeded error. Whoops!

Like a fool, I tried to debug it using only the small test cases. That's when I decided to open a Swift playground and make my own 1500 line sample test case, identical to the one Kattis will provide me. I ran it, and lo and behold I found an infinite loop. Looking closer at it, I realized that this error was a basic 429 one: integer overflow. I quickly changed the int to a long, and the code ran perfectly fine and quite fast as well.

I plan on using C++ more and more for coding challenges, because I eventually plan on doing some sort of development on a Windows platform and getting more comfortable with a language should be a top priority!
