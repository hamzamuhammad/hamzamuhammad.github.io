**What did you do this past week?**

- Finally finished the SWE project (through grinding day and night at the GDC) and finished some other miscellaneous homework items. I feel like since it's getting close to the end of the semester, it's pretty much crunch time.

**What's in your way?**

- We have a security project due on Friday at some point (so we have to start on that soon) and there is a quiz or two in one of my culture classes (along with an essay to write). I expect to be fairly busy, but not to the point to where I can't do my daily things such as workout or chillax.

**What will you do next week?**

- The final SWE project is due that week, so we will have to get it done and figure out whatever small things we may need to fix. It's certainly much less work than the last endeavor, so I'm hopeful for a relaxed workload.

**Tip of the week**

- My doctor told me I apparently have a vitamin D deficiency from spending too much time indoors, so make sure to go outside in between long periods of coding to soak up that sun!

**Experience of the class**

The last project was quite a challenge due to the various disciplines needed to complete it. For example, we had to deal with both the backend and the frontend not to mention the connection between the two. We made a crucial mistake of starting it a bit late, along with not accounting for various bugs with regards to deployment. It taught me a valuable lesson about procrastination as well as proper time management.

While going through the project, I encountered completely new technologies such as Google Cloud Platform, React, and SQLAlchemy. They were easy to pick up and somewhat manageable with regards to making it work with our project, but truly mastering and getting the bells and whistles takes a higher level of mastery. For example, at times we were forced to write 'duct tape' code that temporarily fixed a problem until we cleaned it up later. This also tied in with a constant cycle of planning, implementation, and testing that made sure our product was top-notch and simply a fast, well-oiled machine. 

Learning this sort of development process really helped me plan out and design any project I would set my mind to - the great part about a full-stack project is that large-scale obstacles and principles are learned. Furthermore, understanding the glue that connects the front and backend further explains how a web app works.

At the end, a tough deadline along with hard-working and dedicated teammates (not to mention every group member contributing more than their fair share) got the project done. I had quite a lot of fun doing it, and after it was all done I was still itching to go further and keep programming! Software development is truly a passion deeper than money!
