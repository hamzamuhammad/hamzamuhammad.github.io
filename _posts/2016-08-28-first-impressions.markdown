What did you do this past week?

- Last week, I rented the required textbook for the class through Amazon. It should arrive on Thursday, but in the meantime I can read the online textbook. 

What's in your way?

- I have to start doing the readings, and reviewing the notes from the lecture. In addition, I'm anticipating homework and projects which I will have to look into early on so I can ask any questions I may have.

What will you do next week?

- Next week, I expect to get the first project for this class. From what I found from previous classes, it will involve a lot of extra stuff that may have a learning curve. I probably need to spend more time on this.



OOP reminded me a lot of CS314 with Scott. The class was short, but extremely focused and spent a good deal on language design and real-world stuff, such as unit testing instead of asserts. I honestly have a good feeling so far about OOP, and I'm excited to see what else the class has to offer.

An interesting comparison I keep on seeing is how much Java differs from C++. One language isn’t necessarily better than the other, but the differences are important when thinking of stuff on a large scale. This may be a bit confusing for interviews, since data structures were taught in Java but I’m sure this knowledge is easily transferable. 

I’m also interested in the testing suite that will be used, as well as the other technologies used to facilitate software development. It seems like a refreshing change from my previous classes.
