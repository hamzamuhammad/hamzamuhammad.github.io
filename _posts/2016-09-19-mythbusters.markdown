What did you do this past week?

- Started on the Netflix project, as well as submitted various homework for other classes. I also started to plan out what I will be doing during the career fair, in terms of dress and my elevator pitch.

What's in your way?

- I have to get a bunch of assignments finished before the end of the week. The OOP project, algo homework, iOS homework, etc. are one after the other. I will have almost no free time, especially with the career fair coming up as well. I must make it a priority to get an internship for the summer, so I am willing to skip class to do so!

What will you do next week?

- There will be an algo test the week after next, so I must start preparing for that as well as a test for an elective class. I honestly have no idea how hard this upcoming test will be, but at least it is not in the same week as OOP!


There was a tech talk from Bloomberg regarding real software engineering practices, and I was surprised to learn that many of the topics we learn in OOP are applicable to industry practices. For example, continuous integration from software such as TravisCI is heavily used in order to make sure that new code doesn't break old code.

The talk also focused on the lifestyle of a software engineer, and I was happy to hear that a fair amount of people skills and meetings were involved. I honestly had this fear that a job as a software engineer would consist of 8 hours of pure coding. Not that I would mind, but I do value a well-rounded job.

During the actual lectures, the concept of iterators was introduced. This is crucial to understanding data structures on a deeper level, since the higher-level concept of something like a 'for each loop' depends on this. The differences between the types of iterators illustrated the capabilities of a given object's iterator.

All in all, the tech talk stood out the most for me. Especially with the career fair coming up, I have a stronger grasp of what a job really requires.
