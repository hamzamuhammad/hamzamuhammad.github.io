**What did you do this past week?**

- Submitted Collatz, and started to get into the thick of things. Also spammed a bunch of internship applications as well as going to jiu-jitsu as often as I can!

**What's in your way?**

- I've started getting spammed with interview coding challenges, so I have to start with that. I also need to focus on CTCI instead of hanging out and having fun (while the semester is easy so far). After Netflix, I expect things to get interesting.

**What will you do next week?**

- Keep going to jiu-jitsu, keep up with interviews, and get ready for career fair. That means ya boi gotta dress fly and be fresh like the Whole Foods salads section. I also need to print resumes out, and trim my beard so I don't look like a savage.

**Tip of the week**

- Listen to music from the happy times in your life!

**Experience of the class**

Although the class is pretty much copy pasting OOP for the first few weeks, I am starting to see differences with regards to how C++ and Python are different. For one, the Collatz project was a bit different than the one given in OOP - these differences greatly changed how the algorithm and solution was built. Since C++ is a faster language in general, much optimization was needed with regards to the Python solution.

I also started to take massive Ls on the quizzes now, similar to OOP. In addition, the workflow is as rigorous as I remember, especially with the multitude of steps and requirements before you submit the final project. Even after you turn it in, you're still never 100% sure that you did it properly.

So far, I haven't really gotten into the thick of the class (where you eventually build a web app with a group of students) but so far Python seems like a really clean and concise language. It also have very fast development speed, which is very useful for certain projects one may do. 

All in all, I don't have enough information to write more about the class but so far I am optimistic about the technologies we will learn. As every student knows, the first few weeks are generally light in workload, so to TRULY judge a class you gotta give it a bit.
