What did you do this past week?

- Took my Algo and PoD test. I felt like I did pretty poorly on Algo (lord give me a good grade) but as Obama once said "All I do is cash out!". As for the other test, it's pass-fail so who cares am I right? Just kidding; I should put forth more effort into BOTH classes instead of being lazy. It's a hard habit to break!

What's in your way?

- A bunch of iOS homework to do, on top of the OOP test (which scares the absolute bejeezus out of me). I have to grind as hard as possible on MTW and try my best on the test. I may even go beyond grinding and straight up become C++. 

What will you do next week?

- Prep for the OOP test and finish any remaining homework. Also, if the OOP project drops, I gotta cop that and start bumping it in the GDC. 


OOP and iOS seem to collide pretty often. Not in the terms of pure code, but in the concepts that both classes need in order for a student to be successful.

While OOP is much lower-level (in terms of overall abstraction), iOS throws you into dealing with every aspect of development. I often use skills gained from both disciplines interchangeably whenever I tackle a new problem.

For example, just a few hours back, I was working on the iOS homework and I dealt with the problem of different target builds. iOS recently updated to iOS 10 and Swift 3.0, which was unfortunately pretty incompatible with not only the teacher's uploaded code but many old-fashioned ways of iOS development. I decided to try and incorporate the old code into a new Swift 3.0 project and that went EXTREMELY poorly. I guess it's either because I am trash at iOS or because there are underlying bugs present with the fresh release. 

Yeezy taught me that blaming the computer and code is a surefire way to not learn anything. Always assume it's your own fault, and only then will you develop your skills to further analyze and break down a problem. 

When OOP started talking about various interfaces and abstractions, I realized how tricky navigating this terrain of objects truly is. Casting objects, having proper scope, and proper initialization are crucial to good speedy development. I had issues similar to iOS with clang-check on Docker (among other things!) as well as iostringstream. 

Not to sound cheesy, but a lot of things tie together and part of being a good software engineer is finding these patterns.
